## Game Components

### Landing Page
What will a player see when they start your game?

### Game Initialization
What will a player see when the game is started?

### Playing The Game
What will be the flow of the game, what will the user be expected to do and what will the user expect from the gam

### Winning The Game
What does it look like when the game ends, what determines winning or losing?

### Game Reset
How will the user restart the game once it has been completed.

## MVP

Include the full list of features that will be part of your MVP

## POST MVP

Include the full list of features that you are considering for POST MVP
## Functional Components

Based on the initial logic defined in the previous game phases section try and breakdown the logic further into functional components, and by that we mean functions.  Does your logic indicate that code could be encapsulated for the purpose of reusability.  Once a function has been defined it can then be incorporated into a class as a method.

Time frames are also key in the development cycle.  You have limited time to code all phases of the game.  Your estimates can then be used to evaluate game possibilities based on time needed and the actual time you have before game must be submitted.
